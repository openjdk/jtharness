    This package provides a means for creating a set of questions
    to be asked by a "wizard". 

    <p>A wizard is a tool that asks the user a series of simple questions, 
    in order to achieve a complex goal, such as installing, configuring 
    or using a complex piece of software. Each question is represented
    by an object which defines the text of the question to be asked, and
    the type of the response that is expected. Each question also
    specifies the next question to be asked, which may depend on the 
    answers to any of the questions that have already been asked.
    All questions belong to an "interview", and the complete set of
    questions for a wizard may be grouped into one or more different
    interviews.

    <p>By design, questions are simple to write and do not have any
    dependence on any GUI API: the presentation of the questions 
    of a wizard is left to a separate utility: more than one may be
    available. 

    <h2>Guide to writing wizards</h2>

    The questions for a wizard are most conveniently written as a
    series of anonymous inner classes.
    Each question extends the appropriate subtype of {@link com.sun.interview.Question Question},
    depending on the appropriate type of response. Normally, the arguments to
    the supertype constructor are the interview which contains
    the question, and a short name to identify the question. Anonymous
    initializers are used to complete the setup of the question, and 
    each question defines a {@link com.sun.interview.Question#getNext getNext} method to
    define its successor. This method will be called whenever the response
    to the question changes, and may return different values depending
    on the response to this question and any other questions that have 
    already been asked.  If the user has not yet answered a question, or
    has answered it incorrectly, the <code>getNext</code> method may return
    <code>null</code>. This will prevent any tool processing the questions
    from moving beyond this question until a valid response has been given.<pre>
    Question name = new StringQuestion(interview, "name") {
	{
	    setText("what is your name?");
	}

	protected Question getNext() {
	    return age;
	}
    }
</pre>
    <p>Questions can conveniently be created as fields within
    an implementation of {@link com.sun.interview.Interview Interview}.
    <pre>
    Interview personal = new Interview("personal") {
	{
	    setFirstQuestion(name);
	    setTitle("personal questions");
	}

	private Question name = new StringQuestion(this, "name") {
	    ...
	};

	private Question age = new IntQuestion(this, "int") {
	    ...
	};

	private Question sex = new ChoiceQuestion(this, "sex") {
	    ...
	};
    }
</pre>
    
    {@link com.sun.interview.FinalQuestion FinalQuestion} is a special type of
    question that is used to indicate the end of an interview, and does
    not provide any response. You may still choose to set some text to be
    presented to the user, to announce that they have reached the last question. <pre>
    Question end = new FinalQuestion(interview, "end") {
	setText("This completes the interview.");
    };
</pre>
    You can invoke one interview from another by using the 
    {@link com.sun.interview.Interview#callInterview callInterview} method,
    to recursively invoke a sub-interview before continuing to 
    process to the next question in the current interview. 
    The sub-interview will begin at the first question in that
    interview, and will proceed until an instance of 
    <code>FinalQuestion</code> is found, at which point control will revert
    to the successor question given to <code>callInterview</code>.
<pre>
    Question a5 = new ...Question(....) {
	....

	protected Question getNext() {
	    callInterview(subInterview, a6);
	}
    };

    // this question will be asked after the subInterview has been completed
    Question a6 = new ....Question(...) {
	...
    };
</pre>
