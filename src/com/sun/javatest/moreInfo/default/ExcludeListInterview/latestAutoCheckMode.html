<body>
If you choose "Periodically", the next question asks you to specify
the frequency.
<p>
If you choose "Every Test Run", the harness checks with the
test suite web site before every test run to determine if an updated
exclude list exists.  If one exists, the harness downloads it and
uses it for the test run.
