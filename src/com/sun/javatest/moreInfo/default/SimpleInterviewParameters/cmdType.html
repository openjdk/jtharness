This configuration interview allows you to run tests 
in two ways:
<ul>
<li>Tests are executed on the same machine running the harness,
in another process, by means of the <code>Runtime.exec</code> Java
API method. This is usually the most convenient way to run tests if
your tests can be run in a JVM on this machine.

<li>Tests are executed on some other machine, by means of the
JT Harness Agent.  This method may be preferable if the test system
cannot run the harness or cannot start
processes.
</ul>
