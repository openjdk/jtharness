# Template Editor

You can open the Template Editor by choosing Configure \> New Template, Configure \> Load Template,
or Configure \> Load Recent Template in the Test Manager menu bar. Like the Configuration Editor,
the Template Editor provides users with the following two modes of displaying and working with the
questions and values in a template.

-   Question Mode
-   Quick Set Mode

The harness always opens the Template Editor in Question Mode.

In Question Mode, the Template Editor displays all of the questions in the interview and enables the
Bookmarks feature. You can use the Bookmarks feature to only display those questions in a template
that a user must answer.

You can use the View menu at any time to change from one mode to the next. Because there is only one
template file loaded in the Template Editor at a time, when you change viewing modes during an
editing session, any changes that you have made in one viewing mode are automatically reflected in
the other viewing mode.

See [Question Mode](questionModeTE.html) for detailed information about using this mode to create or
edit templates.

In Quick Set Mode, the Template Editor filters out the test suite specific questions and displays
the remaining questions in logical groupings of the values. The Quick Set Mode displays them in tab
form for easy user navigation and access. These values are the same as those values displayed in
Question Mode. Only the form of their presentation to the user is different.

In Quick Set Mode, the Bookmarks and Search functions are not enabled.

See [Quick Set Mode](quickSetTE.html) for additional information about using this mode to edit
templates.
