# Graphical User Interface

The GUI consists of a desktop containing a set of tools that enable the user to configure and run
tests, monitor test status, evaluate and analyze test results, generate reports, and view log file
contents.

The harness attempts to restore the previous desktop when it displays the GUI. If you used a
[command-line option](../command/setupCommands.html) (such as, `-newdesktop`) to start the harness
or if a previous desktop does not exist, the harness displays the Quick Start wizard. See the
*Command-Line Interface User\'s Guide* for detailed information about using specific values and
setup commands in the command line to start the GUI.

The Quick Start wizard guides you through the process of setting up the GUI for a test run. See
[Quick Start](../start/quickStart.html) for information about using the Quick Start wizard.
