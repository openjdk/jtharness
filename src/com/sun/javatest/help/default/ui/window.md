# Test Manager Tool

browse test information, and to troubleshoot a test run.

You can launch the Test Manager at any time by choosing Tools \> Test Manager or by choosing File \>
Open Quick Start from the menu bar.

The harness also automatically opens a new Test Manager when you perform one of the following
actions:

be displayed in the menu bar. See [Menus](desktopMenus.html#desktopMenus) for a description of the
desktop menus. See [Appearance Preferences](../ui/appearancePrefs.html) for a description of how to
change the layout style.
