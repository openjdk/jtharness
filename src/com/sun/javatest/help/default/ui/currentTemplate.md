# Current Template View Filter

When you select the Current Template view filter, the Test Manager only displays the status of the
folders and tests selected by the template on which the current configuration is based.

Select the Current Template view filter by either choosing View \> Filter \> Current Template from
the menu bar or choosing the Current Template view filter from the tool bar.
