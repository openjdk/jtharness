This feature changes the color of input in a text field based on its status. To change the color
preference for text input, select File \> Preferences, and select Color Preferences. The following

Clicking OK saves all changes. Clicking Cancel closes the dialog and negates any changes you have
made and closes the dialog. Clicking Restore Defaults brings back the default settings without
closing the dialog.

-   To choose a color swatch click the Swatches tab, and click a swatch. The Preview area shows the
    possible use of the color in a text field. Once a color has been selected, the block on the
    right shows the original value on the top, and the current value on the bottom. Clicking OK
    applies your change and closes the dialog. Clicking Cancel closes the dialog without changes.
    Clicking Reset restores the original value without closing the dialog.\
