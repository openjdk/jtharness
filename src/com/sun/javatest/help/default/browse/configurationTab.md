# Configuration Pane

The Configuration tab displays a two-column table of the name-value pairs that were derived from the
configuration file and actually used to run the test. To view this information, select a test from
the test tree and choose the Configuration tab.

![Configuration information
tab](../../images/JT4configurationTab.gif){longdesc="configurationTab.html"}

The contents of this pane vary for each test suite. Because the table contains values that were used
when the test was run, it may provide valuable information when troubleshooting a test run. Refer to
your test suite documentation for detailed descriptions of the name-value pairs for your test.

## Name

The names in the table identify test environment properties used by the harness to run the test.

## Value

The values displayed in the table were used to run the test.
