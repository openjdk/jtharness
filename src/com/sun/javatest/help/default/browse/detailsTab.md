# Test Run Details Pane

Click the Test Run Details tab to display a two-column table of name-value pairs that were recorded
when the test was run and may provide valuable information when troubleshooting a test run. Refer to
your test suite documentation for detailed descriptions of the result property name-value pairs for
your test.

[]{#detailsTab.name}

## Name

The harness derives property names from the test results file and displays them in the table with
the following defaults:

-   Information about the version of the harness used to run the test
-   Information about the operating system used to run the test
-   Date and time the test started
-   Date and time the test ended
-   Additional details recorded by the test script used to run the test

Because the properties listed in the table are a function of the test that you are running, the
contents vary for each test suite.

Information written by commands, tests, and scripts as they are executing is displayed in the Test
Run Messages pane.

[]{#detailsTab.value}

## Value

The values displayed in the table are from the test results file created by the harness after
running the test.
