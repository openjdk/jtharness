# Using Command Files

A command file is a text file that contains one or more commands used by the harness from the
command line or as a part of a product build process. You can place combinations of configuration
settings and commands in the command file and use it to repeatedly perform the following actions:

-   Perform test runs
-   Write test reports

The advantage of using the command file format is that it is easy to use a complex, persistent,
repeatable set of commands in a command line.

The commands used in a command file are a formatted set of commands, executed in the sequence that
they appear in the command string. Use the commands in the command file as you would if you were
writing a script. See [Formatting a Command](formatCommands.html) for a description of the formats
you can use.
