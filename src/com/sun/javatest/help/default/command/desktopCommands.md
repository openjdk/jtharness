# [Desktop Options and Preferences]{#settings}

In most cases, command-line options perform functions that are also available through the GUI.
However, there are several situations in which using command-line options to specify how the harness
starts are uniquely useful or necessary.

When starting the harness you can use options in the command line to perform the following tasks:

-   [Use a new desktop](newDesktop.html#newdesktop) when starting the harness GUI.
-   [Restore tools state](newDesktop.html#resume) when starting the harness GUI.
-   [Specify a look and feel](settingColors.html#settingLAF) when starting the harness GUI.
-   [Change the status colors](settingColors.html#settingColors) when starting the harness GUI.
