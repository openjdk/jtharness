If your test group provides an existing configuration, you can use it to run tests.

2.  Locate and select the configuration file (`.jti`).
3.  Click the Load button.

If you loaded a configuration file that you must edit before running tests, use the Configuration
Editor to set appropriate values for your test environment. See [Editing a
Configuration](editConfiguration.html).
