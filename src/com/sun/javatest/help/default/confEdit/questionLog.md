# Displaying the Question Log

The harness creates a log file of all the completed questions in the current, saved configuration
file and their answers. The harness does not update the question log until you save the
configuration file or click the **Done** button in the Configuration Editor.

Open the Question Log of the current, saved configuration file by choosing View \> Configure \> Show
Question Log from the Test Manager menu bar.

The log provides a list of all questions in the saved configuration with links to the following
details about each question:

-   Question
-   Question tag
-   Question description
-   Response (if appropriate)
