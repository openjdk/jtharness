  <body>
    <p>This package provides a configuration interview for legacy test 
      suites which do not provide their own interview, and also provides
      sub-interviews which may be used to build a custom interview with
      standard questions for the standard sections.  These sub-interviews 
      provide the necessary API to make it easy to delegate the implementation 
      of the various methods defined by {@link com.sun.javatest.InterviewParameters} 
      to the corresponding methods in the sub-interviews.

      @since 3.0
