Now that you have completed the interview, you can begin to run
tests:
<ul>
<li>
If you started the editor directly, you can now use:
<dl>
<dd class="menupath">Run Tests <code><b>&gt;</b></code> Start </dd>
</dl>
to start the test run.
</li>
      
<li>
If the editor started because you originally chose:
<dl>
<dd class="menupath">Run Tests <code><b>&gt;</b></code> Start</dd>
</dl>
the JT Harness harness will offer to start the test run for you when you
dismiss the editor.
</li>
</ul>
