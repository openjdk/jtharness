    You can control the amount of test result output the tests emit:
    <table width="100%" border=0 cellpadding=0>
      <tr valign="top">
	<th scope=row width="70">
	  Low
	</th>
	<td>
	  The tests emit minimal status information about failed test cases and emit no
	  information about test cases that pass.

      </tr>
      
      <tr valign="top">
	<th scope=row width="70">
	  Medium

	<td>
	  The tests emit minimal information about all executed test cases.

      <tr valign="top">
	<th scope=row width="70">
	  High
	</th>
	<td>
	  The tests emit extra information about the status of all tests.  This
	  information can be very useful when debugging failed tests.
