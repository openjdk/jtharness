    You can control the amount of test result output the tests emit:
    <table width="100%" border=0 cellpadding=0>
      <tr valign="top">
    <th scope=row width="70">
      Low
    </th>

      The tests emit minimal status information about failed test cases and emit no
      information about test cases that pass.
      <br>
    </td>
      </tr>

      <tr valign="top">
    <th scope=row width="70">
      Medium
    </th>
    <td>
      The tests emit minimal information about all executed test cases.
      <br>

      </tr>

      <tr valign="top">
    <th scope=row width="70">
      High
    </th>
    <td>
      The tests emit extra information about the status of all tests.  This
      information can be very useful when debugging failed tests.
