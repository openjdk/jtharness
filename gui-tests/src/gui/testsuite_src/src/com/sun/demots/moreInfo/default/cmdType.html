You can run the Demo TS two different ways:
<ul>
<li>On the same computer that runs the JT Harness harness (in a
separate JVM) by means of the <code>Runtime.exec</code> Java API
method.
</li>
<li>On another computer or device using a JT Harness Agent.  The
JT Harness Agent runs tests on a separate computer and communicates
with the JT Harness harness over the network.  Choose this answer if
you cannot run your tests on the same computer that runs the JT Harness
harness.
</li>
</ul>
